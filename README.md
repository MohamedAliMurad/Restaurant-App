# Resto App

This project is a restaurant application built with React and Vite. It includes a variety of pages such as Home, About, Dishes, Review, Order, Login, Signup, and more. The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing and context for managing the login state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resto-app.git
   cd resto-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

### Build

The built files will be located in the `dist` directory.
